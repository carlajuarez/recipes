  <p>You can make this cream of broccoli soup recipe in about a half an hour, so it's the perfect choice for busy
    weeknights!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>8 cups broccoli florets</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li> 2 cups milk</li>
    <li>Pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until tender. Add
      broccoli and broth, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender
      with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving
      before leaving it on to puree</li>
    <li>Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and puree
      the soup right in the cooking pot.</li>
    <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium to medium-low heat; stir in flour and add milk. Stir
      until thick and bubbly, and add to soup. Season with pepper and serve.</li>
  </ol>
