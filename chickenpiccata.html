  <p>When it comes to boneless skinless chicken breasts, people tend to either love them or hate them. For those in the
    latter group, this chicken piccata recipe is here to convert you.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. drained capers, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>4 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Slice chicken breasts in half crosswise into 4 cutlets and lightly pound each piece between sheets of plastic
      wrap until an even thickness (about 1/2 thick or less). Season lightly with salt. Place flour in a medium shallow
      bowl.
      Working one at a time, place cutlets in bowl and toss to coat in flour. Knock off excess flour and transfer to a
      plate.</li>
    <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the
      pan, cook cutlets, without moving them, until deeply browned underneath, about 2 minutes.
      Turn over and cook on the other side just until chicken is nearly cooked through, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a
      clean plate.</li>
    <li>Add garlic and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to the skillet and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if needed to keep
      garlic from scorching, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
      Add wine and capers and cook, swirling pan and scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of skillet, until
      liquid is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water, followed by the butter. Swirl pan
      vigorously while butter melts to help it form an emulsion with water, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Return chicken to skillet and simmer until chicken is cooked through and sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon,
      about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir lemon juice into sauce; season with salt.
      Transfer chicken and sauce to a platter and top with parsley; serve with lemon wedges.</li>
  </ol>
