  <p>Double the recipe, pop one in the freezer, reheat it in a baking dish a month later, and appreciate having already
    had your dinner planned and ready ahead of time.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds ricotta</li>
    <li>8 ounces mozzarella, grated</li>
    <li>1 ounce parmesan, grated</li>
    <li>10-ounce frozen chopped spinach</li>
    <li>3 cups marinara sauce</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Preparation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat eggs in a large bowl until light, airy, pale in color, and can
      nearly hold peaks, 6-8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add flour and salt, beating well between additions, until no clumps of flour remain. With mixer speed on low,
      slowly pour in 1 1/2 cups water and continue to beat until well incorporated. Cover and let dough rest at least 2
      hours</li>
    <li>Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium and spray with nonstick spray. Pour 2 Tbsp. batter into skillet and
      cook, swirling skillet constantly to encourage crepe to form a nice, round shape, until set, 15-20 seconds.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Mix egg yolks, ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan in a large bowl; season with salt and
      pepper. Squeeze out excess liquid from spinach, if using, and add to egg mixture; toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Spread 1 cup sauce in a 13x9" baking pan. Working one at a time, spoon 2 Tbsp. filling in center of crepe.
      Spread filling all the way to the ends. Roll up crepe, then flatten slightly with your hands. Transfer seam side
      down to prepared dish. Working in batches if needed, repeat with remaining crepes and filling, leaving a small gap
      in between each</li>
    <li>Top with sauce and cover with foil. Bake manicotti until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, 35-45 minutes.
      Let manicotti cool slightly in pan to set, about 15 minutes. Top with Parmesan and pepper before serving.</li>
  </ol>
